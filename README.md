## Blender Feature Sets
This repository contains a collection of Blender scripts developed as part of pre-internship tasks for qualification when applying for an internship at FOSSEE OpenFOAM GUI Team,IITB. These scripts introduce custom operators and UI panels for generating 3D objects and manipulating geometry within Blender's 3D View.

### Feature Set 01: Generate and Manage Cubes
This feature allows users to generate a grid of cubes based on a composite number input. It includes options to:
1. Generate cubes arranged in a grid layout.
2. Delete selected cubes.
3. Clear all cubes from the scene.

### Feature Set 02: Generate 3D Sine Wave
This feature generates a 3D sine wave mesh based on user-defined parameters:
1. Amplitude: The height of the wave.
2. Frequency: The number of oscillations.
3. Number of Points: Defines the resolution of the wave.

### Circular Paraboloid Generator
This feature creates a 3D circular paraboloid surface using the equation z = x² + y².

## How to Use
  Install Blender (v2.80+).
  Load the scripts into Blender's Text Editor and run them.
  Access the new UI panels under the 3D View tab to generate cubes, sine waves, or a circular paraboloid.
